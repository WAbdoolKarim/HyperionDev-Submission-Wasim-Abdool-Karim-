Above is a link to the project I'm most proud of working on. It is an online interactive dashboard for tracking the prevalence of different SARS-CoV2 variants around Africa. There is only one contribution from me on github because much of the work I did in the project was before it was uploaded onto github. I also co-authored a paper on the dashboard which can be found at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01276-9
